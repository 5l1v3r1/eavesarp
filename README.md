# Eavesarp

A reconnaissance tool that analyzes ARP requests to identify hosts that are likely communicating with one another, which is useful in those dreaded situations where LLMNR/NBNS aren't in use for name resolution.

## Requirements/Installation

`eavesarp` requires Python3.7 and Scapy. After installing Python, run the following to install Scapy: `python3.7 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

# How it do?

Using Scapy, `eavesarp` simply:

0. Listens for broadcasted ARP requests
0. Tracks number of times each host resolves the MAC for a given IP
0. Dumps the counts to stdout

# Example Output

We can see from the following output that `172.16.122.95` is a popular host. Wonder what services it has running? Something cleartext? SMB? Spoof a sender and find out!

*Note*: Blank fields in the *sender* column indicate that the target has been requested by the most recent sender, for example: the first reference to target `172.16.122.81` in the output below was requested by sender `172.16.122.59`.

# Usage

Though there are a few more options, `eavesarp.py` can be started by simply: `python3.7 eavesarp.py`. The most interesting options are likely `-ss` and `-ts`, which allow the user to filter requests for desirable IP addresses.

Use the `--help` flag for more information:

```

  --target-addresses TARGET_ADDRESSES [TARGET_ADDRESSES ...], -ts TARGET_ADDRESSES [TARGET_ADDRESSES ...]
                        Capture requests only when the target IP address is in
                        the argument supplied to this parameter. Input is a
